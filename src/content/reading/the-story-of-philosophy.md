Will Durant's classic introduction to philosophy remains one of the most accessible and engaging surveys of Western philosophical thought. Rather than presenting dry academic summaries, Durant brings philosophers to life by exploring their ideas in the context of their times and personal struggles.

## What Makes This Book Special

- **Biographical Approach**: Understanding philosophers as human beings with real struggles
- **Clear Explanations**: Complex ideas made accessible without dumbing down
- **Historical Context**: How philosophy evolved through different eras
- **Engaging Prose**: Durant's writing is both scholarly and entertaining

## Key Philosophers Covered

- **Plato**: The foundations of Western philosophy and the theory of Forms
- **Aristotle**: Logic, ethics, and the systematic study of nature
- **Francis Bacon**: The scientific method and empiricism
- **Spinoza**: Ethics, determinism, and the nature of God
- **Voltaire**: Enlightenment thought and social criticism
- **Kant**: Epistemology and the limits of reason
- **Schopenhauer**: Will, suffering, and pessimism
- **Nietzsche**: The death of God and the will to power
- **John Dewey**: Pragmatism and progressive education

## Why I'm Reading This

As someone who works at the intersection of technology and impact (through RootIQ), I'm increasingly interested in the philosophical questions underlying our work:

- What constitutes knowledge and truth? (Epistemology)
- What is the good life and how should we live? (Ethics)
- How do we balance progress with wisdom?
- What are our responsibilities to future generations?

Durant's book provides a foundation for thinking about these eternal questions.

## Progress Notes

Currently working through the chapters on Plato and Aristotle - fascinated by how their ideas about forms, knowledge, and politics still resonate 2400 years later.
